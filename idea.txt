[Feature]   Program Settings, let the user set:
    - Which tables to practice e.g. 15's Multiplication Table
    - All random/All low confidence exercises/ Default difficulty algorithm

[Feature]   More sound effects and animations
    - Color feedback on answer box not only sound cue.

[Detail]    Place website link 'ezrillex.club' on the corner of the GUI

[Feature]   Custom font's and font size.
    [Obstacle]  Would have to restart program or update frame

[Feature]   Check for updates functionality
    - Would launch a separate updater.exe that connects to ezrillex.club to check if there is a new version and update
        the files by overriding them with the downloaded ones and deleting unused files.
    [Obstacle]  Do a checksum to check for file integrity, because corrupted files would break the program.
    [Obstacle]  If the update includes major save file formatting changes the old files won't work with the updated
        version so the updater should also fetch a updater_file_re_creator.exe that takes old files, checks from which
        version they are and does the according conversion to the new file formatting. E.g. previous json files that now
        their data is inside a SQL database. So the re creator would read the json data and insert it into the database.

[Feature]   Help Button in GUI and Help Option in CLI
    - Provide appropriate documentation on how to use the program, how it works, and any needed video tutorials.

[Detail]    Confidence Matrix Axis Labels

[Change]    Better saving progress methods in the GUI.

[Change]    Streaks based difficulty algorithm.
    - Minimum of 288 random exercises to properly initialize the confidence matrix
    - If streaks > x
        random_exercise_chance -= 5%    #Starts at 100%
    - So that the more streaks, the more exercises with low confidence the user gets. In order to try to break the
        streak.

[IMPLEMENTED]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Change]    Better matrix class saving.
    - Now the matrix class saves data for each .set() a better way to do it is to write directly to the attribute
        self.data[x][y] = value and defining a .update() that calls .save(self.data)
